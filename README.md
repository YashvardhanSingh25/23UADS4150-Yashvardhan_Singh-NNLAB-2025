# Neural Network Question Solutions Repository

This repository contains solutions to Neural Network subject questions, provided by Mr. Abhishek Sir.

Each question's solution is organized in a separate folder within this repository for clarity and ease of access.








&#x20;   1\. WAP to implement a Perceptron using numpy in Python.&#x20;

&#x20;   2\. WAP to implement the Gradient Descent algorithm for perceptron learning using numpy and Pandas.

&#x20;   3\. WAP to evaluate the performance of perceptron with linear and sigmoid activation functions for a regression and binary classification problem respectively.&#x20;

&#x20;   4\. WAP to train and evaluate a three-layer neural network using Tensor flow library to classify MNIST handwritten digits dataset.

&#x20;   5\. WAP to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network using Keras Library to classify MNIST fashion dataset. Demonstrate the effect of filter size, regularization, batch size and optimization algorithm on model performance.&#x20;

&#x20;   6\. WAP to train and evaluate a Recurrent Neural Network to predict the next value in a sample time series dataset.&#x20;

&#x20;   7\. WAP to retrain a pretrained imagenet model to classify a medical image dataset.&#x20;

Mini Project 1: Build an image dataset that contains grayscale images of leaves of various plants/trees growing in MBMU campus. Perform necessary preprocessing steps to make the dataset uniform and ready for training. Train a deep autoencoder network that can reproduce any random image of a leaf from MBMU campus.&#x20;

Bonus: Can we use this network to identify if a leaf is from MBM Campus or not?

Mini Project 2: Create an Android App that captures the readings from motion sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) in an android phone. Build a dataset using this application that contains the motion characteristics of an average person driving a two-wheeler. Build a LSTM classifier that takes any 3 second sample as input and classifies it as Kankar Road, Bitumen Road, Concrete Road, Single Speed Breaker and Multiple Speed Breakers.&#x20;


Mini Project 3: Build a Video Dataset that contains short videos (max. 5 seconds) of students performing Yogasanas (atleast 6 asanas) with diverse backgrounds, ambient lighting and clothes. Train a CNN that can identify the asana being performed in the video.&#x20;

Bonus: Can we further rate the asana pose as Good, Average and Poor?
